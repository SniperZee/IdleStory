ok i think that's enough copying off of wip incremental time to be new

hey xp system kinda works, now that i got the basic battle system out the way let's freshen this up
time for css

ok got a background set, now i just need to figure out how to get some maplestory sprite rips
no way bannedstory is gone? welp
oh there's a backup

this backup isn't gonna work, and the other program i've found is currently down. it is open source, though
i'll just have to build it myself
oh well, placeholders for now

time to get it animated, somehow

hey that actually looks half decent. somehow
how the fuck did i do that?
HOW DID I DO THAT?
